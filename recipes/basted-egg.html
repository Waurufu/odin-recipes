        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe produces a <em>delicious</em>, <em>simple</em> egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk.</p>
        <p>It's similar to a poached egg, but more <em>flavorful</em> and less fussy. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter </li>
            <li>2 <strong>large</strong> eggs </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water </li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over <em>medium heat</em>. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, <em>yolks are still runny</em>, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and <em>flaky</em> salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
